    Kenshi Yonezu's music video for his latest digital single, "Haiiro to Ao" (Gray and Blue), featuring the popular young actor and singer Masaki Suda reached 
    1 million views within 24 hours of its release.The 26-year-old singer-songwriter currently has six songs charting on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, including 
    the long-lasting No. 1 hit "Uchiage Hanabi" with holding steady at No. 3."Haiiro to Ao" is a poignant song about two childhood friends who have drifted 
    apart in adulthood. In the video, they reminisce about old times separately and wonder what the other is doing ("The chipped moon before the sun rises / 
    I wonder if you're looking at it somewhere too," Yonezu sings, with Suda on backup vocals) but viewers can see that they are in fact visiting the same 
    places at different times, brought together by their shared memories.
